# Initializing the project

## Data structures and Algoritms to be used and reasoning why:
- Hashmaps for storing user information, user id for key and user data for the value, quick lookup
- Linked List for storing the history of a user's bookings
- Merge sort for sorting a movie by the title, year, &c..
- Matrix to represent the seat availability and seating plan of a theatre/showtime
- Set to store booked seatings to prevent duplication
- Queue to store the booking process
- Stack where users can undo their actions in a booking process such as cancel or go back
- Binary search for looking at a sorted movie array
